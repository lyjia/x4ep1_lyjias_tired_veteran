Adds new gamestart, "The Tired Veteran"

*'Join the Space Force!' they said. 'See the universe!' they said! Well... you did all that. Then the war ended: a cease-fire with the Holy Order, the so-called Second Accord of the Sacred Relic. Rather than stay and fight the Xenon (or those Kha'ak fuckers), you've decided to take an honorable discharge and spend your accumulated savings on a surplus mil-spec Perseus and a couple of station blueprints. Everyone knows the cease-fire won't last long, but now you're a free agent. What will you do? Where will you go? Who will you kill?*

Built from salvaged bits and pieces of other mods and by poking around various game XML files. Special thanks to [CAS](https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=181&t=405102) for lots of useful samples to learn from.
